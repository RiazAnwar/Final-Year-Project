                 Blood is something we all expect to be there for us when we need it, yet only 4% of us give blood - many people would not be alive today if it wasn't for the generosity of our donors. Most people can give blood, but all donors have to meet the eligibility criteria before their blood is accepted to ensure there's no risk of us harming you or the patients who will receive it.
