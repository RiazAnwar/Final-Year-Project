             <p>Founded in 2001 with induction of one dental surgeon, the Dental Clinic has flourished and grown into a state of the art modern dental clinic to cope with the growing number of patients.
</p><p>It has become the Centre of Excellence in the area and is housed in a purpose-built facility with five dental surgery rooms, equipped with hi-tech dental chairs, digital X-rays and other necessary accessories.
</p><p>It has a separate designated room for sterilization, which is equipped with type B latest autoclaves. The instruments are scrubbed manually and cleaned, washed in the ultrasonic bath and then packed in the pouches and sterilized in the autoclaves.
</p><p>There is also a large waiting area, which is child-friendly and suitable for patients with special needs.
</p><p>There are six consultants and two medical officers. All our consultants are foreign qualified and specialists in their respective fields. We have specialists in Restorative dentistry, implant dentistry, Oral Surgery, Orthodontics, Pediatric dentistry, Prosthetic dentistry, Periodontology and Endodontics. We provide tooth whitening, smile makeover and aesthetic dentistry.
</p><p>We also provide lingual braces/invisible braces, which are fitted behind the teeth and we take pride in being the first such centre in Islamabad.
</p><p>As a multi-skilled dental centre the workload has increased over the last decade and this trend is still on which shows our patients’ confidence in our high quality services. We strive to provide the best quality dental care to our patients
