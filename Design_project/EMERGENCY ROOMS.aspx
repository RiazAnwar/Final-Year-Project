            <h3>PATIENT GUIDE TO ER</h3>
             <p>This Guide has been prepared to answer questions about your care at SIH’s Emergency Department, where our main priority is to provide quality care with a personal touch.</p>
            <h3>How long will I have to wait?</h3>
            <p>Every effort will be made to see patients as quickly as possible. We know your time is valuable, and when you are ill, any amount of time waiting can seem like an eternity.</p>
         <h3>Triage</h3>
             <p>We use a system called triage to determine he seriousness of your illness or injury. We try to see patients on a first come first serve basis. However, sometimes more severely injured or ill patients are given higher priority and will be taken care of first.</p>
             <h3>Fast Track</h3>
             <p>Fast Track is a special service with in the emergency room for the treatment of minor illness and injuries, such a sprains, cuts and lacerations, possible fractures, minor burns, wound care and the flu. With the back-up of Emergency Department physicians, Fast Track is staffed by certified nurse practitioners, nurses and technicians.</p>
             <h3>May I have Visitors?</h3>
             <p>In the most cases, one or two family members or friend may stay with a patient in the treatment area. In case of serve illness or injury or physician evaluation, family members may be asked to remain in the waiting room until all the procedures and testing are completed. If the patient is a small child, parents are allowed to remain in the treatment area.</p>
             <h3>Will I have to wait for a consultant?</h3>
             <p>Although SIH’s full-time emergency physicians can treat a broad range of medical problems, it is sometimes necessary to call in a consultant to provide the most effective treatment for you. Sometimes delays can occur waiting for a specialist if the doctor is in surgery or must leave his clinic to come to the ER. But please remember, these decisions are made in your best interest-diagnosis often takes time.</p>
             <h3>How much time will the doctor spend with me?</h3>
             <p>SIH’s Emergency Department physicians spend as much time as necessary to obtain a complete patient history and assessment to make an accurate diagnosis. Time is also spent evaluating laboratory and X- ray results or in consulting with other physicians. In emergency medicine, we spend most of our time on your diagnosis in order to treat you effectively.</p>
