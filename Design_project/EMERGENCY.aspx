             <p>Hospital’s emergency department deals with routine patient inflow as well as patients referred from other hospitals and offer services in all sub specialties of medicine and surgical disciplines.
</p><p>In emergency department we do triage on all patients. Triage is the mechanism by which we evaluate and prioritize patients based upon a defined system. We also utilize a new concept called RAAT (Rapid Assessment and Treatment) by a doctor at the front door.
</p><p>Depending on need, we are equipped to take help from all lab tests and radiological procedures to evaluate the patient. Our patients are treated by experienced physicians in emergency medicine and a senior doctor is always available in the department.
</p><p>We follow standardized practices of emergency care and expedite the process to sort out all patients within 4 hours. It helps improve the patients flow and enhances patient satisfaction. Shifa international Hospital’s Emergency Department, just like the Hospital, is a story of consistent growth in terms of scope and quality of crucial emergency healthcare.
