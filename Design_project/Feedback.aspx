                 Patient feedback consists of the views and opinions of patients and service users on the care they have experienced. Healthcare organisations can gather patient feedback in a variety of ways including surveys, audits, comments and complaints. Staff who work directly with patients can also offer a useful perspective.

                 When to give feedback or complain

Many hospitals have surveys you can complete when you are discharged from their care. Take this opportunity to let them know about both the positive and negative aspects of your experience. You can also give feedback about your care at any time.

You can make a complaint if you feel that you:
were not given satisfactory healthcare
were not treated with dignity and respect
were not given adequate information about services or treatments, including costs, so that you could make an informed choice
were not given access to information about your healthcare when you asked for it
did not give consent and your health information was shared inappropriately with others
had your privacy breached.

How to make a complaint

If your complaint is about how a hospital has treated you, they often have a formal complaints process that they can guide you through. Information about how to put in a complaint is usually located on the health service’s website, and complaint or feedback forms are often attached.

Speak directly with the healthcare professional

Try to talk with the person you have an issue with about your concerns. This is the quickest and often the easiest way to address an issue. In your conversation, outline your concerns and how the incident or issue has affected you. It may be a misunderstanding or something more serious.

Speak with someone representing the hospital

If you feel talking directly to the healthcare professional has not helped improve the issue, or you are uncomfortable with this approach, you can make your complaint to the health service. Talk with a clinic manager or staff at the reception desk to find out where you should direct your complaint or feedback.

All health services have processes for hearing and dealing with complaints within their organisation, and many hospitals have a consumer liaison officer or patient representative who deals with patient feedback. 

Make your complaint in writing and let them know how you would like the situation resolved (a written reply or a meeting). Follow up with them if you do not receive a response. 

Lodge your complaint with a regulatory body or authority

If you are unhappy with the responses from the healthcare professional involved or the hospital they represent, you can lodge a formal complaint with an independent, regulatory body or authority. It is a good idea to phone the regulatory body or authority first, to make sure they are the right organisation to deal with your complaint. They will explain their complaints process to you.
