            <p>Liver transplant is a treatment option for people with liver failure and for some people with liver cancer who have significant complications due to end-stage chronic liver disease. The chronic liver failure may be caused by a variety of conditions. Among other causes, Hepatitis B & C viruses remain the major cause of cirrhosis leading to liver failure and liver transplant. Cirrhosis is so far the most frequently cited reason for a liver transplant.</p>
            <p>It is estimated that over 5 million people in Pakistan require Liver Transplantation at any stage during their treatment. The availability of sustainable and quality Liver Transplantation & Hepatobiliary surgery services in Pakistan is a great benefit to the local population, which previously had no option than to go overseas for the treatment.</p>
            <p>Today, Pakistan is among the World’s leading nations who have been successfully providing Liver Transplantation services to their people in conformity with International quality & patient safety standards. It is a landmark achievement in Pakistan’s medical history that such a complex and advanced surgical treatment has been provided at Shifa International Hospital Islamabad to Pakistanis by utilizing the expertise of Pakistani healthcare professionals.</p>
