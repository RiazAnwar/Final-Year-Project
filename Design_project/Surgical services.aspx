                 We understand that not everyone knows what to expect when going into surgery, so we make every effort to guide each of our patients through the process so that they have the best experience possible. Our highly trained surgery team is dedicated providing state of the art care to all patients. This includes pediatric, adolescent, adult, and geriatric patients. Person Memorial Hospital’s surgical services include general surgeries, gastrointestinal procedures, orthopedic surgeries, ophthalmic surgeries, and ear, nose and throat surgeries.
